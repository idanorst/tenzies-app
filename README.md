# The Tenzies Game
This game was made following a tutorial on YouTube from 'freeCodeCampers'. Most of the logic behind the game is made by following the tutorial, but I have also added some extra features. Here is what I've added: 
-> Each die is made a real die, and not just a sqaure with a number. 
-> Tracking of number of rolls used to get tenzies.
-> Tracking of the time used to get tenzies. 
-> Saving the best time to Local Storage.
